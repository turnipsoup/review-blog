- Notes: Inscryption is a card game like no other. For one to truly enjoy this game you must go in with as little spoilers as possible - because of this I will keep this review brief.

I really enjoyed this game. The entire experience was unpredictable yet cohesive. The horror aspects of the game could have been a tad spookier, but the game itself was fantastic. The art was great, and shows that you can easily tie low-rez and high-rez into the same world. I would have wished the end game was a little more difficult, though.

If you are a fan of deck builders, horror, secret hunting, and good writing then I fully recommend this game.
