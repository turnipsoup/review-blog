- Notes: Loop Hero is a great "I want to watch YouTube and have something to fiddle with" game. The art is amazing, the detail on the pixel art is just wonderful. The game does feel a little too grindy. I understand that Rogue-lites are supposed to be that way, but you need to play _so many rounds_ to unlock the River, for example.
