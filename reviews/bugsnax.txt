- Notes:  BugSnax is a bizzare adventure in all of the best ways. It is a children's adventure that did not shy away from getting too deep into the water.

You start as a failing reporter who is often trying to sell stories of cryptids, etc. You (and a lot of other people) have heard about a respected academic who has found an island full of edible creatures. You seem to convince your boss for one last chance and you set off towards the island.

The island's inhabitants are a lively bunch, and their personalities do not match very well - however this just adds to the charm of the people and their interactions. The characters created by the game designers were great to hang around and their development was fun to watch.

The BugSnax themselves were all adorable, entertaining, troublesome, and frustrating all at once. The catching of the BugSnax was certainly difficult at times, especially for some of the "rarer" ones. Taking a photo of a BugSnax with the camera would give you details on how to catch it, very much giving of a Pokemon Snap feeling.

The game took me by surprise when it had the final test of skill - the events to get off the the island. Characters you had grown to love had a real chance of dying on the island. In my playthrough I lost Scorpy. The game does give you a chance to redo the island escape if you want - but I had felt it was time for me to move on from this game.

This was an excellent experience, and I do recommend it to all.
