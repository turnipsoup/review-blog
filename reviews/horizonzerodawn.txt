- Notes: This game is beautiful.

The story, the heroine, the NPCs, the environment, the machines, and everything else. This world is a wonder to explore.

There is so much about this game that are examples of good game design. One that stands out particular to me is the introduction/tutorial missions. You do these missions as your main character when they were a small child - this add a fun thematic experience that carries the player through the tutorial with ease.

The world is vast with lots of nooks and crannies. I do wish there were more secrets to find in the far flung corners, but I was still happy with what was found.

This is a good game and I look forward to playing the sequel.
