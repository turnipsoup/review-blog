- Notes: Resident Evil: Village sets out to outperform its predecessor and achieves that goal spectacularly. From examining the design choices, to appreciating the art - we can see that this game was made by game loving professionals.

The choice of the main village setting was a good divergence from the previous game - where you felt like you always had a center of operations as opposed to just a tiny trailer. The addition of a merchant character was also a welcoming change which added both some comfort and a tad bit of humor. The merchant's appearance and demeanor certainly added positively to the atmosphere of the village. 
 
The environments that the player explores were exquisitely detailed and there was plenty to explore which added to the story and lore. The characters were certainly fun to interact with, even if some of the boss fights left something to be desired. 
 
Overall Village presents the player with an excellent experience. The replayability presented via the Mercenaries mode as well as the unlockable modifications for the weapons in the Story mode give the feeling that you should try again - and you should.
